For some reasons I need interpreter for Lisp like language in Rust.    
As first step I study how to build 'own' Lisp with C with the tutorial   
[Build Your Own Lisp](https://buildyourownlisp.com/contents)    
[Build Your Own Lisp; GitHub](https://github.com/orangeduck/BuildYourOwnLisp) 

```mpc.c``` and ```mpc.h``` files are downloaded from   
[orangeduck/mpc](https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc) the ```mpc``` parser library

The work is in progress.
